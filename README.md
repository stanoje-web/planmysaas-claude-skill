## 📦 Install

One command. The skill auto-discovers from your `~/.claude/skills/` folder on startup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/creationskiro/planmysaas-claude-skill ~/.claude/skills/planmysaas
```

That's it. Restart Claude Code (or open a new session) and the skill is live.

---

## 🚀 Use

In Claude Code, run the slash command:

```
/planmysaas "your one-line saas idea"
```

Or just describe a product idea naturally — Claude picks up the skill from the description:

> *"Help me plan a SaaS for AI + robotics learning for school students"*
>
> *"Turn this idea into a structured blueprint: AI tutor for JEE students, voice-first, ₹99 per month"*
>
> *"I want to build a course platform for college students. Give me an architecture and feature list."*

The skill writes a fresh `./planmysaas-blueprint/` folder in your current project directory. Open `README.md` first — it indexes the rest.

---

## 📁 See what you get back

Each file in `./planmysaas-blueprint/` is a deep, structured document written for **engineers and founders, not for marketers**. Below are screenshots from the [PlanMySaaS dashboard](https://planmysaas.com) showing what the equivalent sections look like when rendered visually. The skill outputs the same data as markdown, split into 29 individually-tracked artifacts plus a locally-generated review dashboard with its own charts (see [🖥️ The review dashboard](#️-the-review-dashboard) below).

### `03-01-competitive-landscape.md` — Real competitor analysis with opportunity scoring

<img src="./assets/02-research-competitors.png" alt="Robopandit competitor analysis with bar chart and table" />

5–8 real competitors, classified into direct / adjacent / substitute / manual-alternative. Each gets an opportunity score from 1–10 based on workflow overlap, weakness exploitability, and differentiation room. Paired with `03-02-switching-costs.md` (friction in / moat out) and `03-03-brand-naming.md` (name, tagline, voice).

---

### `05-07-business-model-canvas.md`, `05-05-swot.md`, `05-10-pmf-score.md` — frameworks, scored

<img src="./assets/03-analysis-bmc.png" alt="Robopandit business model canvas — 9 blocks: value propositions, customer segments, channels, revenue streams, key resources, customer relationships" />

The full 9-block business model canvas, directional TAM/SAM/SOM (`02-01-tam-sam-som.md`), Porter's 5 forces, evidence-grounded SWOT, a scored risk register (`05-08-risk-register.md`), a 6-dimension PMF score breakdown, and an adversarial gut-check (`05-11-the-roast.md`) that refuses to soften into encouragement.

---

### `06-architecture.md` — System design with services, data models, APIs

<img src="./assets/04-architecture-canvas.png" alt="Robopandit visual canvas showing 29 services across modules, services, stores, and external integrations" />

3–5 top-level containers, 10–25 services or modules grouped by domain, 8–15 core data models with relations, 20+ REST API endpoints, background jobs, external integrations, and an opinionated tech stack with one row per layer.

---

### `07-features.md` — Feature specs with user flows + acceptance criteria

<img src="./assets/05-feature-specs.png" alt="Robopandit feature specs page showing 15 features across 9 modules with workflow coverage chart" />

12–20 feature specs, each with a numeric ID (F-01, F-02 …), priority (P0–P3), effort estimate in days, primary actors, purpose, numbered user flow, testable acceptance criteria, edge cases, and telemetry events to fire.

---

### `10-build-playbook.md` — Deep build steps with rubrics, leaf to root

The most important artifact in the blueprint. Not a paste-ready prompt list — a decision-grade build playbook structured as a **dependency tree**: foundation primitives first (repo, deploy pipeline, data layer), then services, then features in priority order, then polish, then ship. Every step includes:

- 🎯 Goal · 📍 Why this comes first · 📥 Inputs · 📤 Outputs
- 🛠 Implementation details (files, tech decisions, mandatory patterns)
- ✅ Acceptance rubric (8–14 testable checkboxes per step)
- ⚠️ Edge cases · ❌ Common pitfalls · 📊 Quality bar (measurable thresholds)
- 🛑 Stop-and-review gate before the next step

The user (or their AI coding tool) follows it step-by-step. Each step's rubric must pass before advancing — no skipping ahead. Reads like a senior engineer's runbook for a high-stakes deploy.

---

### `08-frontend.md` — Routes, wireframes, component tree, design system

<img src="./assets/06-frontend-blueprint.png" alt="Robopandit frontend blueprint showing routes and design system" />

Routes grouped by public/app/admin sections, page specs for the top 8 routes, ASCII wireframes you can read in the markdown file, a component tree of 12–25 reusable components with their key props, and a design system covering colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadow, and motion.

---

### 🖥️ The review dashboard

<img src="./assets/00-artifact-hub.png" alt="Artifact hub showing artifacts organized by category with completion tracking" />

The skill's last stage scaffolds a real **React + Vite + Recharts** site into `./planmysaas-blueprint/dashboard/` — a local, dark-themed equivalent of the dashboard view above: phase progress, a PMF radar chart, competitor opportunity-score bars, a risk matrix scatter plot, TAM/SAM/SOM sizing, unit-economics bars, a SWOT quadrant, Porter's Five Forces, the full Business Model Canvas grid, feature-priority mix, and the release timeline. `cd planmysaas-blueprint/dashboard && npm run dev` and it's running locally — no account, no upload, your data never leaves your machine.

---

## 🎯 Skill vs Dashboard

The skill and the [PlanMySaaS dashboard](https://planmysaas.com) are not competitors. They are the same product expressed at two different friction levels.

### What you get inside a single project

| Capability | This Skill | [planmysaas.com](https://planmysaas.com) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Top-level stages generated | 34 (5 research phases + 5 build stages) | **30+** |
| Total generated pages / artifacts | 34 markdown files + a generated dashboard | **26+ artifacts across 8 categories** |
| Review dashboard | ✓ local React + Vite + Recharts site, generated per project | ✓ hosted, always up to date |
| Sub-views per stage | inline sections | **multi-tab pages** (Research = 8 tabs, Analysis = 9, Architecture = 6, Phases = 9 …) |
| Sidebar workflow groups | 6 phase groups | **7 groups** — Command · Research · Planning · Frameworks · Output · Evolution · Tools |
| Inline charts | ✓ recharts — PMF radar, competitor bars, risk matrix, TAM/SAM/SOM, unit economics, SWOT, Porter's, BMC, feature mix, timeline | ✓ bars, canvas, score dials |
| Visual architecture canvas | text only | ✓ drag-able 29-node diagram |
| Auto-research on real competitors (web search) | Claude only | ✓ deep research, 60 sub-topics |
| **Project documentation page** | — | ✓ a single docs hub per project, auto-generated |
| **Versions + diff view per stage** | — | ✓ rollback to any earlier version, side-by-side compare |
| **Re-run any stage with feedback** | — | ✓ "make this more X" prompts on any output |
| Team collaboration | — | ✓ workspaces + invites |
| Build tracker (post-blueprint) | — | ✓ kanban-style progress, P0 / P1 swimlanes |
| Risk register · decision log · event flows | — | ✓ dedicated pages |
| Exports (PDF, JSON, ZIP, public share link) | — | ✓ |
| Admin-side runbooks (refunds, password resets, etc.) | — | ✓ for ops teams |
| Cost per use | your Claude tokens | credits (100 free) |
| Internet required | — | ✓ |
| Account required | — | ✓ |
| Best for | Solo · in-editor · fast loop | Teams · long projects · iteration over months |

**Use the skill** when you are exploring an idea, prototyping for a hackathon, or already deep in Claude Code.

**Use the dashboard** when the project is real — when you have decided to spend three months on it, when a co-founder joins, when you want exports for a pitch deck, or when you need version history because you will iterate on the wedge based on early customer interviews.

### Beyond the skill — the rest of planmysaas.com

The skill ships the planning pipeline. The web product ships the planning pipeline **plus** a public knowledge surface that the skill structurally cannot include. Free, no signup needed for any of these:

| Surface | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| 🔍 [Ideas directory](https://planmysaas.com/ideas) | **500+ curated SaaS ideas** organised by category — B2B SaaS, Micro-SaaS, AI, FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, No-Code, Developer Tools, Marketing, Weekend Projects. Each idea has a deep page with audience, business model, tech stack, and a one-click "plan this idea" button that pre-fills the blueprint flow. |
| 🛠️ [Free tools directory](https://planmysaas.com/tools) | **12+ founder calculators**, all free, no signup — Runway · Break-even · SaaS pricing · Startup cost · LTV/CAC · MRR growth · Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM) · Business name generator · Customer persona builder · Business plan template · Tech stack recommender · SEO competitor analyzer. |
| 📘 [Guides](https://planmysaas.com/guides) | Step-by-step long-form guides on planning, architecture, pricing, and go-to-market. Structured as a path to a concrete outcome. |
| ✍️ [Blog](https://planmysaas.com/blogs) | Long-form deep reads for SaaS founders — research, frameworks, case studies. Includes the [launch story for this skill](https://www.planmysaas.com/blogs/planmysaas-claude-skill-drop). |
| 📉 [Startup failures](https://planmysaas.com/startup-failures) | Post-mortems of $46B+ in losses — what went wrong and the lesson per failure. |
| 📈 [Startup success stories](https://planmysaas.com/startup-success) | How the best were built. Attached frameworks and decisions. |
| 🆚 [Alternatives pages](https://planmysaas.com/alternatives) | "X vs Y" comparison pages for popular SaaS planning + AI tools. |
| 🆘 [Help center](https://planmysaas.com/help) | Per-page docs for every dashboard surface — Blueprint · Dashboard · Growth · Frameworks. |

The skill is the in-editor cousin of all of this. If you only ever use `/planmysaas`, you still get the blueprint pipeline. If you visit planmysaas.com, you also get a small library of ideas, tools, and case studies for free.

```

29 files live directly under `pipeline/` (flat, sorted by filename — no subfolders) for phases 1–5; see the pipeline table in `SKILL.md` for the full list.

Common tweaks:

- **Change default tech stack** — edit `pipeline/06-architecture.md`. Replace Next.js / Postgres / Vercel with your preferred defaults.
- **Add a stage** — drop a new file like `pipeline/12-marketing.md`, then add it to the pipeline table in `SKILL.md`.
- **Tighten the tone** — every prompt has a *Tone* section at the bottom. Rewrite it.
- **Change the output folder** — search `./planmysaas-blueprint/` in `SKILL.md` and replace.
- **Restyle the dashboard** — edit components under `templates/dashboard/src/`; it's a normal Vite + React + Tailwind + Recharts app, run `npm run dev` inside it directly to iterate.
- **Localise** — add Hindi / Spanish / French versions of any prompt; Claude will follow the language you ask in.

No build step for the markdown pipeline itself. The dashboard has its own `package.json` (installed at generation time, not when you install the skill). Save a prompt file, run `/planmysaas` again, the next invocation uses the new prompt.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

| When | What |
|---|---|
| **Now (v2.0)** | 34-artifact phase-based pipeline · generated React + Vite + Recharts review dashboard · MIT · auto-discovery · markdown output |
| **Next 2 weeks** | Optional `auth.md` for API mode — connect a PlanMySaaS API key to save the project to your dashboard with version history, team collaboration, and exports |
| **Q3 2026** | Skill variants — `/planmysaas-mvp` (faster 4-stage cut), `/planmysaas-validate` (idea validation only), `/planmysaas-redesign` (replan an existing product) |
| **Q3 2026** | MCP server — same engine over Model Context Protocol so it works in any MCP-compatible client (Cursor, Cline, Continue) |
| **Q4 2026** | Localisation — Hindi / Hinglish prompts for Indian founders |

None. The skill runs entirely in your Claude Code session. No analytics, no phone-home, no API calls (in v1). The only network the skill touches is whatever Claude already does for you.

---

## 📜 License

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Fork it, ship it, sell it, build a company on it. Just don't blame us if Claude generates a strange tagline once in a while.

---
