# Stage 10 — Build playbook (the most important artifact)

Generate `./planmysaas-blueprint/10-build-playbook.md`. This is **not** a list of paste-ready prompts. It is a deep, decision-grade build instruction set — the kind a staff engineer would write for a junior team. The user (or their AI coding tool, or a future contractor) will follow this step-by-step to ship the product.

Read every prior stage (all 29 Phase 1–5 files plus `06-architecture.md`, `07-features.md`, `08-frontend.md`, `09-release-plan.md`) before generating. Cross-reference the actual entity names, feature IDs, route paths, tech stack, and wedge from earlier files. A generic playbook is a failed playbook.

## Required output structure

The playbook follows a strict **dependency-tree build order — leaf to root**. Foundation primitives first, then data, services, features, polish, ship. Each step is a node in the tree; later steps cannot start until earlier steps' rubrics pass.

Use this exact skeleton for the output file. Do not deviate — consistency is what makes the playbook usable.

```markdown
# Build playbook — <Project name>

> Decision-grade build instructions for the <Project name> SaaS.
> Follow steps in order. Do not skip rubric items. Stop and review at the gate after every step.

## How to use this playbook

[2 short paragraphs:]
- This is a build sequence, not a wishlist. Each step depends on the previous one.
- After every step there is a "stop and review" gate. Do not advance until every rubric item checks. The next step assumes everything before it works.

## Build sequence — at a glance

[A textual dependency tree — leaf at top, root at bottom. Every step listed with its dependency arrow. Example:]

```
01 Repo bootstrap + deploy pipeline       (no deps — leaf)
   └─ 02 Data layer (Prisma schema)
        └─ 03 Service layer + repositories
             └─ 04 Auth + permissions
                  └─ 05 Core feature P0-1 (<F-XX from 07-features.md>)
                       └─ 06 Core feature P0-2 (<F-XX>)
                            └─ 07 Core feature P0-3 (<F-XX>)
                                 └─ 08 Payments + billing
                                      └─ 09 Frontend polish (loading/empty/error states)
                                           └─ 10 Marketing site + SEO
                                                └─ 11 Production deploy + observability
                                                     └─ 12 Post-launch ops & runbooks (root)
```

(Adjust 9–12 steps based on the project's wedge. If the business model is free, skip step 08. If mobile-first, add a mobile-bridge step.)

## Build Step 01 — Repo bootstrap & deploy pipeline

### 🎯 Goal
[One sharp sentence — what "done" looks like for this step. Must be observable.]

### 📍 Why this is the leaf
[1 paragraph — what every later step assumes. Why nothing else works without this.]

### 📥 Inputs (preconditions before you start)
[Bulleted list — tools to install, accounts to have, env values to acquire. If empty, write "None — this is the leaf step."]

### 📤 Outputs (what exists after this step passes)
[Bulleted list — observable artifacts. Files, deployed URLs, working flows. The user must be able to point at each one and say "yes, that exists now."]

### 🛠 Implementation details

**Files to create:**
[Tree-style list with one-line purpose per file]

**Tech decisions** (locked from `06-architecture.md` — do not re-litigate):
[Bulleted: tech choice — reason. 4–6 items.]

**Patterns (mandatory across the codebase):**
[3–6 bullets. Code conventions every later step assumes. e.g. "All async DB calls return typed Result<T>", "Auth helpers live in src/lib/auth/, never inline in routes".]

### ✅ Acceptance rubric
[8–14 testable checkboxes. Every item must be observable — "user can do X", "command Y returns Z", "page A renders B". No vague "code is clean" items. The reviewer (human or AI) checks each box; if any box fails, the step is not done.]

### ⚠️ Edge cases to handle
[3–5 bullets. Race conditions, expired tokens, empty states, failure modes specific to this step. Each one names the scenario + the required behavior.]

### ❌ Common pitfalls (do NOT do these)
[4–7 bullets. Specific anti-patterns drawn from real failed shipments. Each one starts with "Don't" or "Never". Add a half-line on why it's a trap.]

### 📊 Quality bar
[3–5 measurable thresholds. Lighthouse score, npm audit, test coverage, p95 latency, bundle size — whatever's relevant to this step.]

### 🛑 Stop and review (gate before next step)
[A 3–5 step verification sequence the user runs before moving on. Concrete actions: "Sign up, log out, log in three times. No errors." If any verification fails, the step is not done — do not advance.]

## Build Step 02 — Data layer

[Same skeleton — every section filled with project-specific detail referencing entities from `06-architecture.md`.]

---

[... continue for every step in the dependency tree ...]

---

## Final ship checklist

[A 10–14 item launch checklist that aggregates outputs from every prior step. Each item observable.]

## What to do when a step fails

[3–5 short rules. e.g.:]
1. **Don't skip ahead.** Each step is a foundation. Skipping creates a debt you'll pay 10x later.
2. **Re-read the dependency.** Most failures are caused by a missed input from the prior step.
3. **Check the pitfalls list first** — it exists because someone shipped a bug there before.
4. **Bisect the failing rubric item.** Identify the smallest change that broke it; revert if needed.
5. **If still stuck**, paste the failing rubric item into Claude Code with the playbook open. Reference this file by name so Claude has the full context.

## Why this playbook is different from generic build prompts

[3 short paragraphs about how this playbook is project-specific (references entities, features, wedge from earlier stages), how it sequences (leaf to root, no skipping), and how it gates (rubric must pass before next step). End with: "If a step feels generic, you're missing context — re-read the relevant blueprint stage first."]
```

## Operating rules for generating the playbook

1. **Step count: 9–12.** Less means under-spec'd; more means death by a thousand cuts.

2. **Always reference blueprint stages by name and ID.** "Build feature F-01 from `07-features.md`" — never just "build the first feature". The cross-references are what make the playbook decision-grade.

3. **Acceptance rubrics must be observable.** Every checkbox is something a human can verify in under 60 seconds. No "code is clean", no "performance is good". Yes "Lighthouse perf ≥ 90 on /pricing" or "User can sign up → confirm email → log in within 2 minutes end-to-end".

4. **Pitfalls must be specific.** Generic ("don't write bad code") is rejected. Specific ("don't put NEXTAUTH_SECRET in committed code — it must be env-only") is required. Pitfalls come from real-world failure modes for the chosen stack.

5. **Quality bars must be measurable.** Numbers, not adjectives. "Zero P0 bugs in 24h of test traffic" not "stable". "Bundle size < 250KB gzipped" not "small".

6. **Stop-and-review gates must be active verifications.** Concrete steps the user runs (commands, clicks, observations) — not "make sure it works".

7. **Tech choices are locked.** The tech stack from `06-architecture.md` is the source of truth. Do not propose alternatives in this playbook. If the user wants to change the stack, they go back to `06-architecture.md` and re-run that.

8. **Tone: senior engineer briefing a team.** Direct, specific, no marketing language, no emoji-heavy enthusiasm. The emoji headers (🎯 📍 etc.) are the only emoji — they signal section type, not energy.

9. **Length: aim for 80–120 lines per build step.** Less is under-spec'd. More means you're dumping context that should live elsewhere (in the blueprint stages, not here).

10. **Every step MUST end with a stop-and-review gate.** The gate is what makes this a playbook and not a wishlist.

## Cross-stage anchors (use these consistently)

When the playbook references prior stages, use these exact patterns:

- "From `01-01-problem-validation.md` — your wedge is <wedge>"
- "From `06-architecture.md` — service `<Service Name>` owns <entities>"
- "From `07-features.md` — feature `F-XX <Title>` flow"
- "From `08-frontend.md` — design system tokens (color `var(--brand)`, spacing scale 4/8/12/16/24)"

These anchors prove the playbook is project-specific. They also let the reader jump back to context when a step is unclear.

## Anti-patterns the playbook MUST avoid

- ❌ Paste-ready "prompts" addressed to an AI tool. The playbook is for a *human* (or AI agent) to follow, not for a chat input field.
- ❌ Generic checklists ("write tests", "deploy to prod"). Every item must be specific to this project.
- ❌ Optional steps. If a step is optional, it does not belong in the playbook. Move it to a "Future expansions" appendix at the bottom.
- ❌ Vague success criteria ("works well", "good performance"). Every gate is a test that passes or fails.
- ❌ Missing dependency arrows. If step N can be done before step M, the dependency tree is wrong — re-sequence.
- ❌ Hyped framing ("amazing!", "incredible!", "🚀🚀🚀"). Senior engineers do not speak this way.

## Reference for tone (read this before writing)

The playbook should read like a *senior engineer's runbook for a high-stakes deploy*. Examples of the right register:

✅ "Auth helpers live in `src/lib/auth/`. Never inline auth checks inside route handlers — that path leads to inconsistent session validation and a CVE waiting to happen."

❌ "Set up authentication! 🔐 NextAuth is great for this — let's get you started!"

✅ "Stop-and-review: Sign up with three different emails. Log out. Log in. Verify session cookie is HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax + Secure (in prod). If any of these is missing, you have a security hole — fix before Step 05."

❌ "Make sure everything works before moving on! 👍"

The playbook is the user's senior reviewer. It treats them as an adult engineer who is going to ship a real product to real users.
